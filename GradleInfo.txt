### About Gradle tasks and etc.

Gradle tasks: 

[apply plugin: 'java']
gradle build
	   clean       > Deletes the build directory, removing all built files.
       assembly    > Compiles and jars your code, but does not run the unit tests.
       check       > Compiles and tests your code. 



### Dependency configurations:
compile		> The dependencies required to compile the production source of the project.
runtime		> The dependencies required by the production classes at runtime. By default, also includes the compile time dependencies. 
testCompile	> The dependencies required to compile the test source of the project. By default, also includes the compiled production classes and the compile time dependencies. 
testRuntime	> The dependencies required to run the tests. By default, also includes the compile, runtime and test compile dependencies. 

Example -> compile
	compile group: 'org.hibernate', name: 'hibernate-core', version: '3.6.7.Final'
